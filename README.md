<h3> Book Reviews! </h3>
This is my Second Project using dJango. I learnt how to use allauth and authenticate with google.
I learnt how to delete posts.
This actually looks like a fully fledged website!

<h1> HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT </h1>
1. Make sure that Python is installed in your system,
2. Download the project and activte the virtual environment (I used mac to do this project so idk if this will work on a Windows or Linux machine)
3. cd into Todoproject/
4. "python manage.py runserver"
5. Then, go into your browser and type: "localhost:8000"

This time the website is pretty straight-forward so I don't have to tell you how to use it.
Thanks for looking at my Code!
